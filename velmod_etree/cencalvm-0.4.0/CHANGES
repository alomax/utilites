/**
 * @file CHANGES Summary of changes made to cencalvm query software.
 *
 * \section ver040 Version 0.4.0, 2005/11/05
 *
 * @li Restructured query routines, adding the ability to query the
 * regional model, if desired.
 * @li Updated sample input and output data files to be compatible
 * with release 05.1.0 of the USGS Bay Area Velocity Model, including
 * the abilty to use the regional model, if desired.
 * @li Created extension of VMQuery to be compatible with CIG
 * spatialdata package. This will only be of use in CIG code. Building
 * this extension is turned off by default.
 * @li Fixed bug in query routines where projection routine was called
 * twice. Second, superfluous call was removed. This should speed up
 * queries a very slight amount.
 *
 * \section ver030 Version 0.3.0, 2005/10/07
 *
 * @li Changed examples to include FIXEDRES and WAVERES query
 * types. Improved instructions for the examples.
 * @li Turned on averaging of water points but do not allow mixing of
 * averaging of water and solid material points in averaging by giving
 * solid material points precedence (if attempting to mix the two,
 * ignore the water values).
 * @li Fixed FIXEDRES and WAVERES queries so averaged values aren't
 * used when query wants finer resolution than available. For example,
 * if you want values at 200m resolution and a search says only values
 * at 800m are available, then this location is a "void" at 200m
 * resolution so "NODATA" should be returned instead of the values at
 * 800m. Previous versions would return values at the 800m resolution.
 * @li Switched to GNU build system for easier installtion and
 * portability. Users now run configure to generate Makefiles instead
 * of creating them by hand.
 *
 * \section ver022 Version 0.2.2, 2005/08/10
 *
 * @li Fixed bug where inclusion of assert header file was missing in
 * several source files. This resulted in compiler errors in some
 * cases.
 *
 * \section ver021 Version 0.2.1, 2005/08/03
 *
 * @li Fixed bug in creation routine where Vs for water (-999) was
 * scaled. 'No data' values should not be scaled. The query routine
 * was adjusted to undo this scaling, so 'no data' values will now be
 * consistent.
 * @li Fixed bug in MAXRES query routine. Interior octants were
 * returned in search of etree. Now if an interior octant is returned,
 * the values are set to 'no data'. This only occurred when querying
 * the etree at locations above topography and the water surface.
 * @li Added 'no data' and water points to examples for illustration
 * of those cases.
 * @li Added ability to make creation/averaging routines run quietly
 * (no progress reports).
 * @li Fixed bug in cencalvmcquery where filenames were not
 * initialized to empty string. This created filenames from garbage
 * and log files tended to created by default which is not the desired
 * behavior.
 *
 * \section ver020 Version 0.2.0, 2005/07/29
 *
 * @li Added error handler to allow queries to continue even when
 * values cannnot be found for locations. Coordinates of locations
 * where data was not found can be written to a log file. Values for
 * locations not found are set to predefined value (see \link
 * pkgs/query/README pkgs/query/README \endlink for details).
 * @li Fixed bugs in C and C++ examples associated with setting values
 * to be returned in a query.
 * @li Fixed documentation for units of cache size. Units are MB.
 * @li Added average package for creating database with spatial averaging.
 * @li Finished implementing routines and unit testing of queries
 * at fixed resolution or resolution based on wavelength of shear wave.
 *
 * \section ver011 Version 0.1.1, 2005/07/18
 *
 * @li Fixed errors in documentation and updated Make.mm files in examples
 * directory to reflect name of database in release pre1.0.
 *
 * \section ver010 Version 0.1.0, 2005/07/09
