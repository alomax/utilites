1. How to build the package
###########################

The first thing you need to do is to build the etree library. 

Step 1: Enter libsrc/ directory.
Step 2: Modify the variable in Makefile according to your platform.
Step 3: Type gmake to build the etree library.

You may optionally choose to build the examples. The steps are similar
to that of building the etree library except for a different directory.

To build the programs for building the CVM etree database for the LA basin.

Step 1: Enter cvm/ directory.
Step 2: Read the README file. This is important. You need the instruction in
        README to set the variables correctly in the Makefile.
Step 3: Modify the variables in Makefile properly as instructed.
Step 4: Build the programs and etree database as per the instructions.
